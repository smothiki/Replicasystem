In request.json we have provided test requests under the column "tests" these are the series of requests that will be sent to server
and will compare manually whether the output is as expected or not the output will be saved to Replicationsystem/logs/clog and slog

For verifying proof of concept for a transaction we have written a seperate file clienttest.go which sends the test requests from the json and
sends to the head or tail accordingly
